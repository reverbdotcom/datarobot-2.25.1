        All models using a featurelist, whether as the training featurelist or as a monotonic
        constraint featurelist, will also be deleted when the deletion is executed and any queued or
        running jobs using it will be cancelled. Similarly, predictions made on these models will
        also be deleted. All the entities that are to be deleted with a featurelist are described
        as "dependencies" of it.  To preview the results of deleting a featurelist, call delete
        with `dry_run=True`

        When deleting a featurelist with dependencies, users must specify `delete_dependencies=True`
        to confirm they want to delete the featurelist and all its dependencies. Without that
        option, only featurelists with no dependencies may be successfully deleted and others will
        error.

        Featurelists configured into the project as a default featurelist or as a default monotonic
        constraint featurelist cannot be deleted.

        Featurelists used in a model deployment cannot be deleted until the model deployment is
        deleted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dry_run : bool, optional
            specify True to preview the result of deleting the featurelist, instead of actually

        delete_dependencies : bool, optional
